# Reviewing PRs

#### Graham Barber

```notes
- PRs are like checkpoints
  - Keep unwanted problems out
  - Easy when reviewers are blind
  - Frustration or indifference
```

# Today...

```notes
We're going to cover
- Objectives
- What to look for
- CASS's recommended process

Applies to GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
```

---

## Objectives

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Ensure functionality</li>
    <li>Maintain readable code</li>
    <li>Prevent technical debt</li>
    <li>Self-improvement</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

## Ensure Functionality

```notes
- Bare minimum
- Tests help to a point
- Above all, **run it**

## Don't introduce broken code

- Prevents rushed-fixes further down the line

- Essential part of Continuous Integration
```

---

## Maintain Readable Code

```notes
- If you don't know what it does, the next person
  probably won't either
- Don't let the writer sit next to you
- Use a formatter

## If you don't understand the code, it will bite

- Documentation is a multivitamin, not a pain reliever
```

---

## Prevent Technical Debt

```notes
- Refactoring *now* is good *late*
- What's done now is not rushed later
- Not everybody knows best or alternative
  practices
- Ask someone else!
- Use a linter

## Don't let anyone take the easy way out

- Never be afraid to request changes
```

---

## Self-Improvement

```notes
- Exposure to diversity is important
  - People solve problems differently
  - People know things that you don't
- Talk with the code writer _after_ looking
  over everything
- Do some research if you need it
  - Ask an expert

> Do your best to make sure you or the writer
  learns something new

- Helps you grow as a developer
```
