# Reviewing PRs

> [Hosted presentation](https://puregarlic.github.io/reviewing-prs)

It's difficult to review PRs â€” you might not know what to look for, or
why you're even bothering to do it. This presentation aims to clarify the _why_
and _how_ questions that inexperienced PR reviewers might have.

This was generated with [mdx-deck][]'s `npm init deck` command.

## Development

To run the presentation deck in development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Edit the [`deck.mdx`](deck.mdx) file to get started.

```sh
npm run build
```

To export a PDF:

```sh
npm run pdf
```

To export an image of the title slide:
